## Approaches

### Row-wise Classification
https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08630

Horizontal scan lines along road section of image (rather than pixel-level analysis), measure distances between points on scan lines with ground truth, draw curve based on points on scan lines

### Parametric Bezier Curve Modelling
https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02431

Pixel-level analysis to find a curved line representing a road line, determine Bezier curve of the line and use that for analysis
