## Overview

At least 200 hours - Average of 8 hours per week
Good communication and documentation required

It is _not_ a requirement to build something unique/innovative
What's important is to follow a proper engineering approach
	Applying, honing, integrating and extending previously acquired knowledge and skills
	Needs to be a clear relationship between  your degree program and the project
		Need to use previously-acquired knowledge and skills
		**Not** the place to learn a brand-new set of skills
	Followed process needs to be documented and will form a major part of the evaluation

Sometimes design doesn't work - need to be able to pivot

## Important Dates

- **Proposal**: October 20
- **Pick Oral Presentation Date**: December 8
- **Progress Report**: December 8
- **Oral Presentation**: January 22-26
- **Final Report Draft**: March 14
- **Poster Fair**: March 27
- **Final Report & Video**: April 10

## Supervisor vs. Coordinator

- Coordinator (non-technical)
	- Looks after administration of projects
	- Organizes departmental-wide events
	- Has no direct involvement in project

- Supervisor (technical)
	- Responsible for regular supervision of progress
	- Responsible for informing student of requirements
	- Governs format of project deliverables within stated guidelines
	- Responsible for providing any required resources
	- Responsible for evaluating student and project deliverables

## Project Resources

- Special requests regarding account must be made by your Supervisor to Daren Russ
	- Extra memory, group or admin rights
	- Create a ticket: service@sce.carleton.ca

- If you need/want to buy specific equipment, who pays?
	1. Instead of having students pay for equipment, done by technicians upon request by students from their supervisor. Projects have a $500 budget.
	2. Your supervisor, from his/her research funding
	3. CSES, Contact VP Finance fnuance@cses.carleton.ca
	4. Capstone and CESEF Funding, Contact Jennifer Wolters JenniferWolters@cunet.carleton.ca

_Lent items from inventory don't count towards the $500 budget_
No inventory (lol?) until next year

## Project Deliverables

- What is a proposal?
- What is a progress report?
- What can you do with your oral presentation?
- What is the poster fair?
- How big should my final report be?

Supervisor is marking the deliverables

## Project Grading

- Two facets of performance
	- Technical achievements
	- Professional conduct
- Different procedure from other courses
	- No course breakdown is given; grade is an amalgam of your year's performance
	- Grade assigned by whole department
	- You have two representatives
		- Supervisor: Biased "insider"
		- Second Reader: Objective "outsider"; largely technical evaluation
- Governed by published departmental grade expectations

#### Summary of Project's Deliverables
- Proposal
- Progress Report
- Oral Presentation
- Poster Fair
- Final Report
- Project-Specific Deliverables

### Grading Guidelines: Final Report

- Statement of objectives
- General organization
- Technical writing and illustrations
- Adequate background information
- Conclusions and recommendations
- Quality of final engineering product
- Engineering techniques used
- Engineering design
- Implementation
- Testing/Experimental Data Used
- Engineering Analysis

### Grade Expectations

A: Outstanding Achievement
B: Good, solid professional engineering work
	B+: Expected typical grade for a successful project
C: Below-average performance
	C-: Minimal acceptable grade average for graduation
D: Performance is below graduation standards
	D- Simply a passing mark for the course credit
F: Is given to those who must repeat the course

## Deliverables: Group Projects
- For all deliverables, there is a choice between individual and group reports
	- Each individual can write their own report or a have a common one
