## Sensor Calibration

- Optimal baseline (distance between cameras)

- Pre-existing setups for calibration
	- https://github.com/uranus4ever/Advanced-Lane-Detection
	- Checkerboard patterns to initialize a calibration matrix?
- Calibration built into OpenCV

## Simulation Machine

- Ubuntu install? Remote access creds?
- Docker setup? How are we going to approach that

## Cameras

- Did the test lens arrive? If so, how well does it work?
- Discuss options for lenses to use for the camera, weigh pros/cons
	- Probably wide angle but we can consider other options too
